diff helped to reduced the lines through which i had to look for errors in code

#How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
.. Helps in restoring old lgos and logics at any point of time required
   Also they may come in handy for back-compatibility.
   Can help me with tracking all contributions made by others on the topic  
   
#Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
..Depends on the purpose of VCS

#How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
..git log gives history of all commits to a resporatory.
git diff gives the exact difference between two codes based on 
their ID's

#How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
..Pretty confident since i can always revert back to a bug-free
state

#How Do You Want to Use Git?
..To help me in Open Source and my own projects in future maybe

#Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
..I haven't set up any workspace yet, will be working in the 
default settings for a while
