#What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
..Turns the directory into Git resporatory. Needed to make
Git resporatories from random and needed directories.

#How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
..Statging area is temporary intermediate between working 
directory and resporatory. It helps to transfer selected files
from working directory to the resporatory.

#How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
..We can segregate all modified files in the working directory
by bringing them one by one(per logic) into the staging area
and then add the commits to the Git resporatory

#What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?
..To make changes oher than a heirarichal development of the broject.

#How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
..It gives a clear idea about branch, parents and merging.

#What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
..Gives a new commit with properties from both codes.

#What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
..Semi-Automatic is a fantastic idea giving pro's of both auto and manual.

#Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
..forks - make a copy of resporatory from one Git account to other
clones - make a copy of resporatory either from local to local or from Git to
local
branches - ???

#What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
..To be able to keep track of local and original resporatory syncs.
