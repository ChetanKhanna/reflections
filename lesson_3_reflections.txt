#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
..when we need to share our work with others, or even as an online backup.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
..It will suit my personal needs and I may not require all changes in my local
machine.

#Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
..forks - make a copy of resporatory from one Git account to other
clones - make a copy of resporatory either from local to local or from Git to
local
branches - ???

#What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
..To be able to keep track of local and original resporatory syncs.

#How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?
..I'll use another platform. It would be harder managing without any such
platform though.

#When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?
..same as branching from lesson_2.
