#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?
..when we need to share our work with others, or even as an online backup.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
..It will suit my personal needs and I may not require all changes in my local
machine.
